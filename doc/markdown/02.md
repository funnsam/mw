# Project setup
## The root
There are 3 folders used for this tool
	- `markdown`: The fun stuff
	- `templates`: Base HTML
	- `website`: The result
And also there is a `preamble.tex` used for every maths block
## The `markdown` folder
	- There **must** be a `_global.cfg` file for global configuration.
		- The only required key is the `template`, used to pick a template file
	- Any folder named `res` will be copied to the final output
	- Any file with extension `.md` will be turned into `.html` file based on a template
	- A file with the same filename as a `.md` or `.html` file with an extension of `.cfg` is a configuration file for that `.md` or `.html` file
		- Used to overwrite the global configuration
## The templates format
	- Template files ends with `.html`
	- Template files uses a syntax simular to the Rust `format!`
		- Curly brackets \(`{...}`\) is used for placeholders
			- A placeholder with a name of `body` will be replaced with the body content
		- Any other name will refer to the configuration file
